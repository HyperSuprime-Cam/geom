How to Contribute

If you've found a bug or have a question
========================================

If you've found a bug, or have a question about using the LSST stack,
please join us at https://community.lsst.org and post a new topic in
the `Q&A` category <https://community.lsst.org/c/qa>`_.

At LSST we don't use GitHub issues to track work. Posting in the forum is
the best way to contact LSST developers and get help.

If you haven't consulted with it yet, the `LSST Stack Handbook
<http://lsst_stack_docs.rtd.org>`_ may also help.

If you'd like to contribute code
================================

We appreciate getting open source contributions to the LSST Stack. Thanks!
We've put together a guide for developing on the LSST Stack at
http://lsst_stack_docs.rtd.org/development/workflow.
